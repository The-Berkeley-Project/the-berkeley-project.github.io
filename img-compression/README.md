# Image Compression

## Installation

`cd` into this directory then run `npm install`  

## What to do
If you modify the `img` folder, make sure to run: `npm run start` in order 
to run the processing script that compresses the images for better end-user experiences.
See gallery.html for an example of how to use the compressed images.
