Hey hot stuff! :heart_eyes_cat: The Berkeley Project back for Spring 2023!!!! We engage around 2,000 students, volunteer 12,000 service hours, and save the city $400,000 every year over 60 service sites. BP Day is a great way to bond with others in your organization, while also benefiting the Berkeley community. This year, BP Day will be on Saturday, April 15. :ringed_planet: Please fill out this form (tinyurl.com/bpspring23) to sign up!! Make sure to have all volunteers fill out the form and list your club under “Group Affiliation,” in addition to appointing one Site Leader to act as our point of contact. Applications are due Sunday, March 5.
We look forward to volunteering with you soon! Please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions, comments, or concerns.
